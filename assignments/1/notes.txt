1b)
The variables on the x-axis is time delay tau, which is the time delay
between the two signals. The y-axis is the covariance between the time shifted
signals u, y.

For C_uy, u is the output, y is the output. For C_yu, y is the output, u is the
input. Since the two cross-covariances simply have the input and output
switched, the two cross-covariances are mirror about tau = 0. This can be
expressed as C_uy(tau) = C_yu(-tau).
TODO: show short proof
note: from book C_yx(tau) = phi_xy(tau) - mu_x*mu_y


1c)
C_uu(tau) = 0 for all tau != 0.
C_uu(0) = 0
Since signal u is random noise.

C_nu(tau) = 0 for all tau since u and n are independent, random signals.

1d)
As lag increases, the estimate suffers from large variances because the value
is computed with fewer data points. As the delay tau becomes large, the leading
1/(N-tau) factor becomes large. To avoid this, a biased estimator can be used,
which does not use tau in the scaling factor.

2a) The magnitude of Y is mirrored about the nyquist frequency. (meaning of coefficients)?
